        <li><strong>Blend the beans. </strong>Once the water is drained, pour the softened beans into a blender with two cups of water. Blend the beans until they turned into a smooth texture (Add more water if the mixture is not completely smooth).</li>
        <li><strong>Place the bean mixture into a large bowl or pot. </strong>Set it aside for later</li>
        <li><strong>Chop up the vegetables. </strong> Cut the red peppers, onions, and habanero peppers.</li>
        <li><strong>Blend the vegetables. </strong>Put all the chopped vegetables and 1 1/2 cups of water into the blender then blend them together. Crush the maggi stock cubes into the blender and continue to blend with the vegetables mixture.</li>

   <h2>Making Moi Moi</h2>
   <h3>Instruction</h3> 
   <ol start="10">
    <li>Lay out as many aluminum foil bowls as you want, as long as it's with the bean mixture limit (Don't forget the aluminum covers as well).</li>
    <li>Pour the bean mixture into each bowl but makes sure it's not completely full.</li>
    <li>Add any toppings in the bowls if you want. My personal favorites are shredded fish and chopped boiled egg.</li>
    <li>Cover each bowl and makes sure that you wrap the edge of the aluminum bowl onto the cover to secure them.</li>
    <li>Place them on the oven rack and put them into the oven (Please don't place it at the top of the oven since the covers will be burned and start the fire).</li>
    <li>Put the oven tray into the oven but under the rack.</li>
    <li>Allow the moi moi bowls to cook for at least 1 hour. However, check them every 10 mins.</li>
    <li>Turn off the oven and open it to let them to cool down before you can serve them.</li>
    <li><b>Voila and Bon Appetit!</b></li>
